    "# In the last challenge where we calculated the BMI, you saw how when we had a number that had a long list of numbers after the decimal point. \n",
    "# For example, if I had divided 8 by 3 and I print this out, you'll see that the value is 2.666666 and if we had just turned this 8 divided by 3 into an integer, right now it's a floating point number,\n",
    "# but if I convert it into an integer, you'll see that all it does is it just chops off everything after the decimal point. \n",
    "# Instead of what we would traditionally do, which is to round the number.\n",
    "# So if it's 2.5 it would go to 3, if it's 2.4 it would go down to 2.\n",
    "# Now in Python it's super easy to round numbers.\n",
    "# All you have to do is to use the round function like this. \n",
    "# If we write round(8 / 3) then it's going to round it into a whole number and you'll see that instead of 2 we actually get 3 now\n",
    "# because 2.6 recurring becomes 3. Now if you wanted to, you can actually go a step further.\n",
    "# You can specify the number of digits of precision you want to round it to.\n",
    "# So if I said I want to round it to two decimal places, then I could write (8 / 3, 2) and then the number of places that I want around it to.\n",
    "# So now our 2.666 recurring becomes 2.67 because I said we should round it to 2 decimal places. So if it makes it easier,\n",
    "# it might be easier if I write it like this. \n",
    "# So 2.666666666 and I'm going to round it to two decimal places and again, I get the same result, 2.67. \n",
    "# Now another way of modifying numbers is instead of dividing, say 8 / 3, we can also use the floor division, so where you have two forward lashes instead of just one.\n",
    "# Now we know that whenever we divide any number by any other number, the result always gets turned into a floating point number.\n",
    "# Now if you didn't want that and you just wanted an integer, so a whole number chopping off all the numbers after the decimal in place,\n",
    "# you can just use the floor division like this.\n",
    "# And in this case, you would get 2 straight away without having to convert it into an integer.\n",
    "# And in fact, if I go ahead and check the data type of the result of this calculation, you'll see that it's actually an integer\n",
    "# whereas if I had just used the single, um, forward slash division, then I get a floating point number with decimal places.\n",
    "# Even if this is a clean division, say 4 / 2, this is still going to become a floating point number and the number is going to be represented like this, 2.0, like so.\n",
    "# Now if we had saved the results of this calculation into a variable instead, then one of the things that you can actually do is to continue performing\n",
    "# calculations on this variable. So for example, I could do 4 / 2, which is going to be equal to 2. But then if I want to divide it by the 2 again,\n",
    "# I could actually say result /= 2. And when I now print results, I'll actually get 1 because it's 4 / 2 then divided by 2 again.\n",
    "# Now very often when you're writing code, say for example if you're keeping track of the user's score,\n",
    "# so you could have score = 0 to begin with and every single time in your code say a user scores a point,\n",
    "# then you can get hold of this score variable again and instead of saying score now equals the previous value of score plus one,\n",
    "# you can simply use this shorthand, +=, so +=1. And now when we print score, you'll see that it's actually equal to 1.\n",
    "# So instead of using +=, you can use -=, which just takes the previous version of score and removes 1 from it.\n",
    "#  *= and /=.So this is really handy when you have to manipulate a value based on its previous value, which you'll have to do a lot in programming.\n",
